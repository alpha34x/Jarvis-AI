Here you can find all the documentation from this assistant and what you can do with it. Join our discord to suggest what things we can add and to try it with the download you can find in our discord (Discord In Bio)



You can activate Jarvis saying his name. When you activate it, you will listen a little sound so you wait until it stops and say what you want. But what things can Jarvis do?

Things you can do:

- Tell him to reproduce whatever song you can find in youtube with the voice commmand: "Reproduce ..."

- Tell him to tell you what time is it with the command voice "What time is it?"
- Tell him to tell you what is the temperature from whatever city with the command voice "I need to know the weather" then Jarvis will ask you about what city do you want to know from
- Tell him to set up an alarm with the command voice "I want to set an alarm" or "I need to set up an alarm", then Jarvis will ask you about the hour and later the minute. (You have to say the number of the hour and then, when Jarvis ask you, the number of the minute) Note: *When you set an alarm you won't be able to use the program until the alarm sound*
- Tell him to sum up, deduct, multiply and divide two values with the command voice "Sum up _ with _" or "Deduct _ with _" or "Multiply _ with _" or "Divide _ with _"
